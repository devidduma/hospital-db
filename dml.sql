It is a neurological disorder in which the body''s immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system, the part of the nervous system outside the brain and spinal cord. The onset of GBS can be quite sudden and unexpected and requires immediate hospitalization. It can develop over a few days, or it may take up to several weeks with the greatest weakness occurring within the first couple of weeks after symptoms appear.',1),
	 ('Multiple Sclerosis','Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a long-lasting (chronic) disease of the central nervous system. It is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, a condition in which the body attacks itself by mistake. MS is an unpredictable disease that affects people differently.

Others may lose their ability to see clearly, write, speak, or walk when communication between the brain and other parts of the body becomes disrupted.',1),
	 ('Muscular Dystrophy','Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a disorder that slowly weakens muscles. Over time, a child’s muscles break down. They are replaced with fatty tissue. MD can make movements like walking and standing up hard to do. It may even cause deformities in the joints.',1),

The spine''s normal curves occur at the cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions in the so-called “sagittal” plane.

Scoliosis is often defined as spinal curvature in the “coronal” (frontal) plane.',2),

The arachnoid is one of three protective layers, collectively known as the meninges, which surround the brain and the spinal cord.',2),
	 ('Stereotactic Brain Biopsy','Stereotactic Brain Biopsy is a common procedure that allows a neurosurgeon to diagnose a brain lesion.

	 ('Atherosclerosis','Atherosclerosis happens when arteries become narrow and hard due to a buildup of plaque around the artery wall.',4),
	 ('Dyslipidemia','Dyslipidemia occurs when the lipid levels in the blood are abnormally high or low.
